a minimal note-taking extension for chrome and firefox ‚ú®

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Before Installation

cleannote uses [Pantry](getpantry.cloud) for its database. So to use cleannote you need to first create a database on Pantry.
```
Go to 'getpantry.cloud'.
Enter your email and click on 'Create a Pantry'.
Enter a name (it could be anything you want) and click on 'Name your Pantry'.
Copy your PantryID to somewhere safe and click on 'Let's Get Started!'.
You can close the website now.
```
After you've created a database on Pantry, you need to give cleannote the PantryID.
```
Download cleannote as a .zip and unzip it somewhere safe (as you'll be keeping it there as long as you want to keep the extension).
Go inside the project's folder and go in either 'Chrome' or 'Firefox' depending on which browser you're installing the extension in.
Open 'background.js' with any text editor you want and add your PantryID in the first line, inside the "" and save it.
Open 'popup.js' and add your PantryID in the first line, inside the "", and again, save it.
```
That's it, now you can move onto Installation.
